[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions in [Go](https://golang.org/)
======

Hi, welcome to my 2nd Advent of Code solutions repository.

The reason why i'm doing this [again](https://github.com/aoktayd/adventofcode) but now in Go is because i want to learn different languages. There is no particular reason for choosing Go, I just wanted to try it out. This repo is also my first "real" Go project, so don't expect any pro gopher code. But any feedback you might have is greatly appreciated.


# Completed puzzles

Every completed puzzle contains a README in the folder which explains the context of the puzzle. You can also check the Advent of Code website for more information.
